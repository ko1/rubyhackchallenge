# (1) Introduction of MRI development culture

## About this document

This document introduces the development culture of MRI. MRI: Matz's Ruby Interpreter (a.k.a. the ruby command you are using) is OSS: Open Source Software. Development of MRI started in 1993 (published in Dec. 1995). Because MRI is OSS, anyone can join in its development. However if you don't know anything about MRI development, it is hard to join. So, this article introduces how we develop MRI.

This document contains:

* How to develop MRI (development flow and support tools)
* How to manage bug tickets
* How to learn about MRI internals and how to get information about the community
* What kind of unsolved issues are there in MRI?

## MRI development flow

Ruby is OSS so that anyone can participate.

"Ruby development" has two meanings:

* Ruby language specification.
* MRI implementation which is one of Ruby implementation.

MRI is the reference implementation of the Ruby language, so that approved Ruby features are implemented on MRI. If we fix a bug in MRI, it means that we also change Ruby's specification. Therefore, when deciding whether to fix bugs, care must be taken to consider loss of compatibility. To be precise, several MRI-specific features exist, such as virtual machine instructions, so not all changes to MRI result in a change to Ruby's specification.

### Repository and Ruby committers

Ruby's primary repository uses Git for source control <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/ruby-core/>. Some people have a right to modify this repository. We call them "Ruby committers". Now we have about 100 Ruby committers all over the world (but the number of active members is much smaller. If you become a Ruby committer, you can't throw away the title of "Ruby committer").

Committers can modify any of the source code of MRI. However, each committer has an area of responsibility. If a committer wants to modify another area, he/she is expected to ask and respect the advice of the responsible committers. For example, ko1 is a VM developer, so that if someone want to change the VM drastically, he wants to be consulted before any changes are committed.

There is no formal code review system. We may check committed patches and point out issues that we notice. We use `git bisect` (or similar techniques) to investigate problems (e.g. bug reports). If we have a big change, we ask other committers for a review.

BTW, there is a mirror of the repository on GitHub <https://github.com/ruby/ruby/>.

## Ticket management

We use [Redmine](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/), a bug tracker, to discuss specification changes, bug reports, and so on. A ticket is filed for each issue.
Notifications of new tickets and any changes about tickets are delivered to the Ruby mailing lists.
There are mailing lists in  English (ruby-core) and Japanese (ruby-dev).
<https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/mailing-lists/>

Most important issues/proposals are filed in English.
Tickets written in Japanese are also acceptable for easy and small issues.

Tickets can be divided into two categories: "Feature request" and "Bug report".

* Feature requests
  * Requests for additions or changes to the Ruby language itself.
  * incidentally, Redmine's URL <https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/> contains the word "bugs" :)
* Bug reports
  * Strange behaviour, performance issues and so on. Everything except for changes to the specification.

When you submit a ticket, you will be asked to choose a description language (English or Japanese). The forwarded mailing list is chosen by this specified language (ruby-core or ruby-dev).

Good bug reports should contain the following:

* Summary
* Reproducible code and environment information to reproduce it (the result of ruby -v, OS, compiler's version and so on)
* Expected behavior.
* Actual behaviour exhibited.
* A patch which solves the issue (if possible).

For details, please check <https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby/wiki/HowToReport> (English)
or Japanese version <https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby/wiki/HowToReportJ>.

Good feature request should contains the following:

* Abstract (short summary)
* Background (What is the issue you want to solve and why. Use-cases)
* Proposal
* Implementation (if possible)
* Evaluation
* Discussion
* Summary

For example, if you submit a "Feature request", then you will certainly be asked "what are your actual use cases?"
This is an extreme example: if you proposed that "this feature should be changed because of inconsistency, but I don't use this feature any more", then your proposal will be rejected (fixing inconsistency is not more important than compatibility).

For further information, please check <https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby/wiki/HowToRequestFeatures>.

Issues or Pull Requests on GitHub are checked occasionally. In other words, sometimes they are ignored.
I recommend you to make a new ticket on Redmine and link to your Issue or Pull Request on GitHub.
Or, you can try to contact to a Ruby committer directly.

## CI on MRI

MRI is a big and complex piece ofsoftware, so it is necessary to use automated testing for Quality Assurance (QA). We have about 450,000 lines of tests across some 5,000 files.

We also need to prepare a variety of environments to run our tests. For example, well-known OSes such as Linux, macOS, Windows, as well as lesser known OSes \*BSD, Solaris and so on.
Usually we use Intel x86/64 CPU or ARM processors, but there are other processors that we try to test on.
The list of Ruby's supported platforms can be found at: <https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/wiki/SupportedPlatforms>.

Because MRI is used on many enviroments, it is preferable to run tests on as wide a variety of environments as possible.
It's common practice to use Continuous Integration (CI) to run automated tests. Ruby is no exception.

In addition to using the popular Travis-CI service, we also run the <http://rubyci.org> site to collect test results run on a wider variety of environments. Typically, a CI system uses its own computing resources. However, our resources are limited. So, instead of preparing and managing the computers for the multitude of environments we need, we gather the results from tests run by volunteers in the community who run tests on their own computing resources. The tool [chkbuild](https://github.com/ruby/chkbuild) builds Ruby, runs tests, generates results, and performs a diff on the output so that we can determine which versions of Ruby have particular bugs.

`chkbuild` is good test/CI framework but, for various reasons (for example, chkbuild downloads source code each time) it can be quite slow (typically tens of minutes). To overcome this limitation, we use another CI system <http://ci.rvm.jp/> that can reuse previous builds, and can build/test in parallel, reducing the time required for testing to the order of 2-3 minutes. This allows us to run our tests hundreds of times every day, which can be helpful for revealing hard-to-reproduce bugs (e.g. timing bugs).

Ruby committers are expected to run tests on their own machines.
If a Ruby committer accidentally adds a commit that doesn't pass the tests, the error should be detected on <http://ci.rvm.jp/> and hopefully committers will be alerted.

## Unresolved issues on MRI

Ruby / MRI has many unresolved issues. The following issues are examples of them.

* Specification
  * Ruby 2.6, ...
  * Ruby 3
    * JIT compilation (only for performance? drop backward compatibility?)
    * Static checking
    * Concurrent execution
* Performance
  * Benchmarking framework and benchmarks
  * Performance improvements
* Documentation
* Bug fixes

The following issues are internal problems I (ko1)  want to fix:

* Improve performance and quality of bytecode serializer.
* Improve method dispatch mechanism.
* Inlining code.
* Increase generational GC supported objects (especially on `T_DATA`).
* Provide CI service to tests gems on trunk.

## Information about Ruby development

### How to hack MRI internals

Please refer to the [Bibliography](../bib.md).

If you want to hack deeply into MRI, you need to know the C language.

## Important note

This article introduces several rather pendantic "rules". However, what we interpreter developers value the most is "Hacking".
If you contribute a great patch, we will support your contribution, even if you don't strictly abide by the above rules.

Write code, and have fun!
